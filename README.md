# "Introduction to Machine Learning" Course of ETH Zurich (Spring Semester 2019)

This is a collaboration of [Sven Gr√ºbel](https://www.github.com/GetPastTheMonkey)
and [Adrian Kress](https://www.github.com/zubinho5).

This repository contains our solutions to the IML project tasks that were posed
in the spring semester of 2019. We made it over the hasrd baseline for every
task, except Task 4, where we only came close to it.
